        -> Summary: How to Set Up a Test Gmail Account for Less Secure Apps
    -> In this lesson, you'll set up a secondary email account for your Python-Flask app
    -> A secondary Gmail account is useful for testing and avoids risking your personal email security
    -> You don't have to use Gmail; the lesson covers Gmail-specific steps, but SMTP setup may vary for other platforms
    -> Set Up a Gmail Account for your App
        -> Step 1: Create a Gmail Account
            -> Head to the Gmail home page and click "Create an account"
        -> Step 2: Enter Account Details
            -> Enter a unique email and choose a username; make sure to remember your password
            -> Use any first or last name as long as it's appropriate
        -> Step 3: Configure Settings
            -> Complete the setup and access your inbox
            -> Click the settings gear in the top right corner
            -> In the settings menu, click "Accounts and Import" then "Other Google Account settings"
        -> Step 4: Turn Less Secure Apps ON
            -> In the "Security" tab, scroll down to "Less secure app access"
            -> Turn "Allow less secure apps" to ON; this is needed for sending emails from Flask
            -> If you can't find this option, continue to the next step
        -> Step 5: Enable Two-Factor Authentication
            -> Go to "2-Step Verification" to enable two-factor authentication
            -> Enter your phone number for security codes, or choose another security method like Google Authenticator
        -> Step 6: Create App Password
            -> Once two-factor authentication is enabled, scroll down to "Signing in to Google"
            -> Click "App passwords" and select "Other (Custom name)"
            -> Name the app (e.g., "flask-webdev") and generate a 16-character app password
            -> Write down the app password for use in your Flask app to authenticate with Google's SMTP server
    -> Now you're ready to configure Flask-Mail to send emails and receive notifications within your app
    -> Summary: To set up a test Gmail account for less secure apps:
        -> Create a Gmail account and enter account details
        -> Access settings and turn on "Less secure apps"
        -> Enable two-factor authentication and create an app password
    -> On to the next lesson!
